/**
 * @file
 * Contains \Drush\Log\Logger.
 *
 * This is the actual Logger for Drush that is responsible
 * for logging messages.
 *
 * This logger is designed such that it can be provided to
 * other libraries that log to a Psr\Log\LoggerInterface.
 * As such, it takes responsibility for passing log messages
 * to backend invoke, as necessary (c.f. drush_backend_packet()).
 *
 * Drush supports all of the required log levels from Psr\Log\LogLevel,
 * and also defines its own. See Drush\Log\LogLevel.
 *
 * Those who may wish to change the way logging works in Drush
 * should therefore NOT attempt to replace this logger with their
 * own LoggerInterface, as it will not work.  It would be okay
 * to extend Drush\Log\Logger, or perhaps we could provide a way
 * to set an output I/O object here, in case output redirection
 * was the only thing that needed to be swapped out.
