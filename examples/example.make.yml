# Example makefile
# ----------------
# This is an example makefile to introduce new users of drush make to the
# syntax and options available to drush make.

# This make file is a working makefile - try it! Any line starting with a `#`
# is a comment.

# Core version
# ------------
# Each makefile should begin by declaring the core version of Drupal that all
# projects should be compatible with.

core: "7.x"

# API version
# ------------
# Every makefile needs to declare it's Drush Make API version. This version of
# drush make uses API version `2`.

api: 2

# Core project
# ------------
# In order for your makefile to generate a full Drupal site, you must include
# a core project. This is usually Drupal core, but you can also specify
# alternative core projects like Pressflow. Note that makefiles included with
# install profiles *should not* include a core project.

# Use Pressflow instead of Drupal core:
# projects:
#   pressflow:
#     type: "core"
#     download:
#       type: "file"
#       url: "http://launchpad.net/pressflow/6.x/6.15.73/+download/pressflow-6.15.73.tar.gz"
#
# Git clone of Drupal 7.x. Requires the `core` property to be set to 7.x.
# projects
#   drupal:
#     type: "core"
#     download:
#       url: "https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal.git"

projects:
  drupal:
    version: ~

  # Projects
  # --------
  # Each project that you would like to include in the makefile should be
  # declared under the `projects` key. The simplest declaration of a project
  # looks like this:

  # To include the most recent views module:

  views:
    version: ~

  # This will, by default, retrieve the latest recommended version of the
  # project using its update XML feed on Drupal.org. If any of those defaults
  # are not desirable for a project, you will want to use the keyed syntax
  # combined with some options.

  # If you want to retrieve a specific version of a project:

  # projects:
  #   views: "2.16"

  # Or an alternative, extended syntax:

  ctools:
    version: "1.3"

  # Check out the latest version of a project from Git. Note that when using a
  # repository as your project source, you must explicitly declare the project
  # type so that drush_make knows where to put your project.

  data:
    type: "module"
    download:
      type: "git" # Note, 'git' is the default, no need to specify.
      url: "https://git.drupalcode.org/project/views.git"
      revision: "7.x-3.x"

  # For projects on drupal.org, some shorthand is available. If any
  # download parameters are specified, but not type, the default is git.
  cck_signup:
    download:
      revision: "2fe932c"
      # It is recommended to also specify the corresponding branch so that
      # the .info file rewriting can obtain a version string that works with
      # the core update module
      branch: "7.x-1.x"

  # Clone a project from github.

  tao:
    type: theme
    download:
      url: "git://github.com/developmentseed/tao.git"

  # If you want to install a module into a sub-directory, you can use the
  # `subdir` attribute.

  admin_menu:
    subdir: custom

  # To apply patches to a project, use the `patch` attribute and pass in the URL
  # of the patch, one per line prefaced with `- `.

    patch:
      - "http://drupal.org/files/issues/admin_menu.long_.31.patch"

# If all projects or libraries share common attributes, the `defaults`
# array can be used to specify these globally, rather than
# per-project.

defaults:
  projects:
    subdir: "contrib"
