# Example of valid statements for an alias file.

# Basic Alias File Usage
#
# In its most basic form, the Drush site alias feature provides a way
# for teams to share short names that refer to the live and staging sites
# (usually remote) for a given Drupal site.
#
# 1. Make a local working clone of your Drupal site and then
#    `cd` to the project work to select it.
# 2. Add an alias file called $PROJECT/drush/sites/self.site.yml,
#    where $PROJECT is the project root (location of composer.json file).
# 3. Run remote commands against the shared live or stage sites
#
# Following these steps, a cache:rebuild on the live environment would be:
#
#   $ drush @live cache:rebuild
#
# The site alias file should be named `self.site.yml` because this name is
# special, and is used to define the different environments (usually remote)
# of the current Drupal site.
#
# The contents of the alias file should look something like the example below:
#
# @code
# # File: self.site.yml
# live:
#   host: server.domain.com
#   user: www-admin
#   root: /other/path/to/live/drupal
#   uri: http://example.com
# stage:
#   host: server.domain.com
#   user: www-admin
#   root: /other/path/to/stage/drupal
#   uri: http://stage.example.com
# @endcode
#
# The top-level element names (`live` and `stage` in the example above) are
# used to identify the different environments available for this site. These
# may be used on the command line to select a different target environment
# to operate on by prepending an `@` character, e.g. `@live` or `@stage`.
#
# All of the available aliases for a site's environments may be listed via:
#
#   $ drush site:alias @self
#
# The elements of a site alias environment are:
#
# - 'host': The fully-qualified domain name of the remote system
#   hosting the Drupal instance. **Important Note: The remote-host option
#   must be omitted for local sites, as this option controls various
#   operations, such as whether or not rsync parameters are for local or
#   remote machines, and so on.
# - 'user': The username to log in as when using ssh or rsync. If each user
#    has to use own username, you can create an environment variable which holds
#    the value, and reference via ${env.PROJECT_SSH_USER} (for example). Or you may
#    omit the `user:` item and specify a user in the `~/.ssh/config` file.
# - 'root': The Drupal root; must not be specified as a relative path.
# - 'uri': The value of --uri should always be the same as
#   when the site is being accessed from a web browser (e.g. http://example.com)
#
# Drush uses ssh to run commands on remote systems; all team members should
# install ssh keys on the target servers (e.g. via ssh-add).

# Advanced Site Alias File Usage
#
# It is also possible to create site alias files that reference other
# sites on the same local system. Site alias files for other local sites
# are usually stored in the directory `~/.drush/sites`; however, Drush does
# not search this location for alias files by default. To use this location,
# you must add the path in your Drush configuration file. For example,
# to re-add both of the default user alias path from Drush 8, put the following
# in your ~/.drush/drush.yml configuration file:
#
# @code
# drush:
#   paths:
#     alias-path:
#       - '${env.HOME}/.drush/sites'
#       - /etc/drush/sites
# @endcode
#
# The command `drush core:init` will automatically configure your
# ~/.drush/drush.yml configuration file to add `~/.drush/sites` and
# `/etc/drush/sites` as locations where alias files may be placed.
#
# A canonical alias named "example" that points to a local
# Drupal site named "http://example.com" looks like this:
#
# @code
# File: example.site.yml
# dev:
#   root: /path/to/drupal
#   uri: http://example.com
# @endcode
#
# Note that the first part of the filename (in this case "example")
# defines the name of the site alias, and the top-level key ("dev")
# defines the name of the environment.
#
# With these definitions in place, it is possible to run commands targeting
# the dev environment of the target site via:
#
#   $ drush @example.dev status
#
# This command is equivalent to the longer form:
#
#   $ drush --root=/path/to/drupal --uri=http://example.com status
#
# See "Additional Site Alias Options" below for more information.

# Converting Legacy Alias Files
#
# To convert legacy alias (*.aliases.drushrc.php) to yml, run the
# site:alias-convert command.

# Altering aliases:
#
# See examples/Commands/SiteAliasAlterCommands.php for an example.

# Environment variables:
#
# Site aliases may reference environment variables, just like any Drush config
# file. For example, ${env.PROJECT_SSH_USER} will be replaced by the value
# of the PROJECT_SSH_USER environment value.
#
# SSH site aliases may set environment variables via the 'env-vars' key.
# See below.

# Additional Site Alias Options
#
# Aliases are commonly used to define short names for
# local or remote Drupal installations; however, an alias
# is really nothing more than a collection of options.
#
# - 'docker': When specified, Drush executes via docker-compose exec rather than ssh
#    - 'service': the name of the container to run on.
#    - 'exec':
#      - 'options': Options for the exec subcommand.
# - 'os': The operating system of the remote server.  Valid values
#   are 'Windows' and 'Linux'. Be sure to set this value for all remote
#   aliases because the default value is PHP_OS if 'remote-host'
#   is not set, and 'Linux' (or $options['remote-os']) if it is. Therefore,
#   if you set a 'remote-host' value, and your remote OS is Windows, if you
#   do not set the 'OS' value, it will default to 'Linux' and could cause
#   unintended consequences, particularly when running 'drush sql-sync'.
# - 'ssh': Contains settings used to control how ssh commands are generated
#   when running remote commands.
#   - 'options': Contains additional commandline options for the ssh command
#   itself, e.g. "-p 100"
#   - 'tty': Usually, Drush will decide whether or not to create a tty (via
#   the ssh '--t' option) based on whether the local Drush command is running
#   interactively or not. To force Drush to always or never create a tty,
#   set the 'ssh.tty' option to 'true' or 'false', respectively.
# - 'paths': An array of aliases for common rsync targets.
#   Relative aliases are always taken from the Drupal root.
#   - 'files': Path to 'files' directory.  This will be looked up if not
#     specified.
#   - 'drush-script': Path to the remote Drush command.
# - 'command': These options will only be set if the alias
#   is used with the specified command.  In the example below, the option
#   `--no-dump` will be selected whenever the @stage alias
#   is used in any of the following ways:
#     - `drush @stage sql-sync @self @live`
#     - `drush sql-sync @stage @live`
#     - `drush sql-sync @live @stage`
#   NOTE: Setting boolean options broke with Symfony 3. This will be fixed
#     in a future release. See: https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/issues/2956
# - 'env-vars': An array of key / value pairs that will be set as environment
#   variables.
#
# Complex example:
#
# @code
# # File: remote.site.yml
# live:
#   host: server.domain.com
#   user: www-admin
#   root: /other/path/to/drupal
#   uri: http://example.com
#   ssh:
#     options: '-p 100'
#   paths:
#     drush-script: '/path/to/drush'
#   env-vars:
#     PATH: /bin:/usr/bin:/home/www-admin/.composer/vendor/bin
#     DRUPAL_ENV: live
#   command:
#     site:
#       install:
#         options:
#           admin-password: 'secret-secret'
# @endcode

# Site Alias Files for Service Providers
#
# There are a number of service providers that manage Drupal sites as a
# service. Drush allows service providers to create collections of site alias
# files to reference all of the sites available to a single user. In order
# to do this, a new location must be defined in your Drush configuration
# file:
#
# @code
# drush:
#   paths:
#     alias-path:
#       - '${env.HOME}/.drush/sites/provider-name'
# @endcode
#
# Site aliases stored in this directory may then be referenced by its
# full alias name, including its location, e.g.:
#
#   $ drush @provider-name.example.dev
#
# Such alias files may still be referenced by their shorter name, e.g.
# `@example.dev`. Note that it is necessary to individually list every
# location where site alias files may be stored; Drush never does recursive
# (deep) directory searches for alias files.
#
# The `site:alias` command may also be used to list all of the sites and
# environments in a given location, e.g.:
#
#   $ drush site:alias @provider-name
#
# Add the option `--format=list` to show only the names of each site and
# environment without also showing the values in each alias record.

# Wildcard Aliases for Service Providers
#
# Some service providers that manage Drupal sites allow customers to create
# multiple "environments" for a site. It is common for these providers to
# also have a feature to automatically create Drush aliases for all of a
# user's sites. Rather than write one record for every environment in that
# site, it is also possible to write a single "wildcard" alias that represents
# all possible environments. This is possible if the contents of each
# environment alias are identical save for the name of the environment in
# one or more values. The variable `${env-name}` will be substituted with the
# environment name wherever it appears.
#
# Example wildcard record:
#
# @code
# # File: remote-example.site.yml
# '*':
#   host: ${env-name}.server.domain.com
#   user: www-admin
#   root: /path/to/${env-name}
#   uri: http://${env-name}.remote-example.com
# @endcode
#
# With a wildcard record, any environment name may be used, and will always
# match. This is not desirable in instances where the specified environment
# does not exist (e.g. if the user made a typo). An alias alter hook in a
# policy file may be used to catch these mistakes and report an error.
# @see SiteAliasAlterCommands for an example on how to do this.

# Developer Information
#
# See https://github.com/consolidation/site-alias for more developer
# information about Site Aliases.
#
# An example appears below. Edit to suit and remove the @code / @endcode and
# leading hashes to enable.
#
# @code
# # File: mysite.site.yml
# local:
# This environment is an example of the DockerCompose transport.
#   docker:
#     service: drupal
#     exec:
#       options: --user USER
# stage:
#   uri: http://stage.example.com
#   root: /path/to/remote/drupal/root
#   host: mystagingserver.myisp.com
#   user: publisher
#   os: Linux
#   paths:
#    - files: sites/mydrupalsite.com/files
#    - custom: /my/custom/path
#   command:
#     sql:
#       sync:
#         options:
#           no-dump: true
# dev:
#   root: /path/to/docroot
#   uri: https://dev.example.com
# @endcode

# Example of rsync with exclude-paths
#
# Note that most options typically passed to rsync via `drush rsync` are
# "passthrough options", which is to say they appear after the `--` separator
# on the command line. Passthrough options are actually arguments, and
# it is not possible to set default arguments in an alias record. The
# `drush rsync` command does support two options, `--mode` and `--exclude-paths`,
# which are interpreted directly by Drush. Default values for these options
# may be specified in an alias record, as shown below.
#
# @code
# dev:
#   root: /path/to/docroot
#   uri: https://dev.example.com
#   command:
#     core:
#       rsync:
#         options:
#           mode: rlptz
#           exclude-paths: 'css:imagecache:ctools:js:tmp:php:styles'
# @endcode
