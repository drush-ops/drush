# Example of valid statements for an alias file.
#
# Use this file as a guide to creating your own aliases.
#
# Aliases are commonly used to define short names for
# local or remote Drupal installations; however, an alias
# is really nothing more than a collection of options.
# A canonical alias named "dev" that points to a local
# Drupal site named "http://example.com" looks like this:
#
# @code
# dev:
#   root: /path/to/drupal
#   uri: http://example.com
# @endcode
#
# With this alias definition, then the following commands
# are equivalent:
#
#   $ drush @dev status
#   $ drush --root=/path/to/drupal --uri=http://example.com status
#
# See the --uri option documentation below for hints on setting its value.
#
# Any option that can be placed on the Drush commandline
# can also appear in an alias definition.
#
# There are several ways to create alias files.
#
#   + Put each alias in a separate file called ALIASNAME.alias.yml
#   + Put multiple aliases in a single file called aliases.yml
#   + Put groups of aliases into files called GROUPNAME.aliases.yml
#
# Drush will search for aliases in any of these files using
# the alias search path.  The following locations are examined
# for alias files:
#
#   1. In any path set in runtime.context in drush.yml
#      or (equivalently) any path passed in via --alias-path=...
#      on the command line.
#   2. In one of the site-specific locations:
#        a. The /drush and /sites/all/drush folders for the current Drupal site
#        b. The /drush folder in the directory above the current Drupal site
#
# These locations are searched recursively.  If there is a folder called
# 'site-aliases' in any search path, then Drush will search for site aliases
# only inside that directory.
#
# The preferred locations for alias files, then, are:
#
#   $ROOT/drush/site-aliases
#   $ROOT/sites/all/drush/site-aliases
#   $ROOT/../drush/site-aliases
#
# Files stored in these locations can be used to create aliases
# to local and remote Drupal installations.  These aliases can be
# used in place of a site specification on the command line, and
# may also be used in arguments to certain commands such as
# "drush rsync" and "drush sql-sync".
#
# Alias groups (aliases stored together in files called
# GROUPNAME.aliases.yml, as mentioned above) create an implicit
# namespace that is named after the group name.
#
# For example:
#
# @code
# # File: mysite.aliases.yml
# dev:
#   root: /path/to/drupal
#   uri: https://dev.example.com
# live:
#   root: /other/path/to/drupal
#   uri: https://live.example.com
# @endcode
#
# Then the following aliases are defined:
# - @mysite.dev
# - @mysite.live
#
# To see an example alias definition for the current bootstrapped
# site, use the "site-alias" command with the built-in alias "@self":
#
#   $ drush site-alias @self
#
# Drush also supports *remote* site aliases.  When a site alias is
# defined for a remote site, Drush will use the ssh command to run
# the requested command on the remote machine.  The simplest remote
# alias looks like this:
#
# @code
# live:
#   remote-host: server.domain.com
#   remote-user: www-admin
# @endcode
#
# The form above requires that Drush be installed on the remote machine,
# and that there also be an alias of the same name defined on that
# machine.  The remote alias should define the 'root' and 'uri' elements,
# as shown in the initial example at the top of this file.
#
# If you do not wish to maintain site aliases on the remote machine,
# then you may define an alias that contains all of the elements
# 'remote-host', 'remote-user', 'root' and 'uri'.  If you do this, then
# Drush will make the remote call using the --root and --uri options
# to identify the site, so no site alias is required on the remote server.
#
# @code
# live:
#   remote-host: server.domain.com
#   remote-user: www-admin
#   root: /other/path/to/drupal
#   uri: http://example.com
# @endcode
#
# The built-in alias "@none" represents the state of no Drupal site;
# to ignore the site at the cwd and just see default drush status:
#
#   $ drush @none status
#
# See `drush help site-alias` for more options for displaying site
# aliases.  See `drush topic docs-bastion` for instructions on configuring
# remote access to a Drupal site behind a firewall via a bastion server.
#
# Although most aliases will contain only a few options, a number
# of settings that are commonly used appear below:
#
# - 'uri': The value of --uri should always be the same as
#   when the site is being accessed from a web browser (e.g. http://example.com)
# - 'root': The Drupal root; must not be specified as a relative path.
# - 'remote-host': The fully-qualified domain name of the remote system
#   hosting the Drupal instance. **Important Note: The remote-host option
#   must be omitted for local sites, as this option controls various
#   operations, such as whether or not rsync parameters are for local or
#   remote machines, and so on. @see hook_drush_sitealias_alter() in drush.api.php
# - 'remote-user': The username to log in as when using ssh or rsync.
# - 'os': The operating system of the remote server.  Valid values
#   are 'Windows' and 'Linux'. Be sure to set this value for all remote
#   aliases because the default value is PHP_OS if 'remote-host'
#   is not set, and 'Linux' (or $options['remote-os']) if it is. Therefore,
#   if you set a 'remote-host' value, and your remote OS is Windows, if you
#   do not set the 'OS' value, it will default to 'Linux' and could cause
#   unintended consequences, particularly when running 'drush sql-sync'.
# - 'ssh-options': If the target requires special options, such as a non-
#   standard port, alternative identity file, or alternative
#   authentication method, ssh-options can contain a string of extra
#   options that are used with the ssh command, eg "-p 100"
# - 'path-aliases': An array of aliases for common rsync targets.
#   Relative aliases are always taken from the Drupal root.
#   - '%drush-script': The path to the 'drush' script, or to 'drush.php'.
#     This is used by backend invoke when drush
#     runs a drush command.  The default is 'drush' on remote machines, or
#     the full path to drush.php on the local machine.
#   - '%drush': A read-only property: points to the folder that the drush
#     script is stored in.
#   - '%files': Path to 'files' directory.  This will be looked up if not
#     specified.
#   - '%root': A reference to the Drupal root defined in the 'root' item in the
#     site alias record.
# - 'php': path to custom php interpreter.
# - 'php-options': commandline options for php interpreter, you may
#   want to set this to '-d error_reporting="E_ALL^E_DEPRECATED"'
# - 'command-specific': These options will only be set if the alias
#   is used with the specified command.  In the example below, the option
#   `--no-dump` will be selected whenever the @stage alias
#   is used in any of the following ways:
#   - `drush @stage sql-sync @self @live`
#   - `drush sql-sync @stage @live`
#   - `drush sql-sync @live @stage`
# - '#peer': Settings that begin with a '#' are not used directly by Drush, and
#   in fact are removed before making a backend invoke call (for example).
#   These kinds of values are useful in conjunction with shell aliases.  See
#   `drush topic docs-shell-aliases` for more information on this.
# - '#env-vars': An associative array of keys and values that should be set on
#    the remote side before invoking drush.
#
# Altering aliases:
#
# It is no longer possible to alter aliases dynamically. This is a planned feature. Help wanted.
#
# Some examples appear below.  Remove the leading hash signs to enable.
#stage:
#  uri: http://stage.example.com
#  root: /path/to/remote/drupal/root
#  remote-host: mystagingserver.myisp.com
#  remote-user: publisher
#  os: Linux
#  path-aliases:
#    - %drush-script: path/to/drush/drush
#    - %files: sites/mydrupalsite.com/files
#    - %custom: /my/custom/path
#  command-specific:
#     sql-sync:
#       options:
#         no-dump: true
