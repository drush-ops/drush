# DRUSH WRAPPER
#
# A wrapper script which launches the Drush that is in your project's /vendor
# directory.  Copy it to the root of your project (or wherever you store handy
# scripts) and edit as desired.  If you already have a folder named 'drush',
# then you may rename this script to 'drush.wrapper' (or, move your 'drush'
# script to __ROOT__/sites/all/drush).
#
# Below are options which you might want to add. More info at
# `drush topic core-global-options`:
#
# --local       Only discover commandfiles/site aliases/config that are
#               inside your project dir.
# --alias-path  A list of directories where Drush will search for site
#               alias files.
# --config      A list of paths to config files
# --include     A list of directories to search for commandfiles.
#
# Note that it is recommended to always use --local when using a drush
# wrapper script.
#
# See __DRUSH__/bin/drush for an explanation of the different 'drush' scripts.
#
# IMPORTANT:  Modify the path below if your 'vendor' directory has been
# relocated to another location in your composer.json file.
