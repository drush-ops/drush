#
# Examples of valid statements for a Drush runtime config (drush.yml) file.
#
# Use this file to cut down on typing out lengthy and repetitive command line
# options in the Drush commands you use and to avoid mistakes.
#
# The Drush configuration system has been factored out and shared with
# the world at https://github.com/consolidation/config. Feel free to use it
# for your projects. Lots more usage information is there.

# Directories and Discovery
#
# Rename this file to drush.yml and copy it to one of the places listed below
# in order of precedence:
#
# 1.  Drupal site folder (e.g. sites/{default|example.com}/drush.yml).
# 2.  Drupal /drush and sites/all/drush folders, or the /drush folder
#       in the directory above the Drupal root.
# 3.  In any location, as specified by the --config (-c) option.
# 4.  User's .drush folder (i.e. ~/.drush/drush.yml).
# 5.  System wide configuration folder (e.g. /etc/drush/drush.yml or C:\ProgramData\Drush\drush.yml).
#
# If a configuration file is found in any of the above locations, it will be
# loaded and merged with other configuration files in the search list.
#
# Version-specific configuration
#
# Drush started using yml files for configuration in version 9; earlier versions
# of Drush will never attempt to load a drush.yml file. It is also possible
# to limit the version of Drush that will load a configuration file by placing
# the Drush major version number in the filename, e.g. drush10.yml.

# Environment variables
#
# Your Drush config file may reference environment variables using a syntax like ${env.HOME}.
# For example see the drush.paths examples below.
#
# An alternative way to populate Drush configuration is to define environment variables that
# correspond to config keys. For example, to populate the options.uri config item,
# create an environment variable `DRUSH_OPTIONS_URI=http://example.com`.
# As you can see, variable names should be uppercased, prefixed with `DRUSH_`, and periods
# replaced with dashes.

drush:
  paths:
    # Specify config files to load.
    config:
      # Load any personal config files. Is silently skipped if not found. Filename must be drush.yml
      - ${env.HOME}/.drush/config/drush.yml


    # Specify folders to search for Drush command files.  These locations
    # are always merged with include paths defined on the command line or
    # in other configuration files.  On the command line, paths may be separated
    # by a colon (:) on Unix-based systems or a semi-colon (;) on Windows,
    # or multiple --include options may be provided. Drush 8 and earlier did
    # a deep search in ~/.drush and /usr/share/drush/commands when loading
    # command files.
    #
    # For testing, specify the namespace component in the key. e.g.:
    #
    # drush:
    #  include:
    #    'Commands/example_drush_extension': '${env.PWD}'
    include:
      - '${env.HOME}/.drush/commands'
      - /usr/share/drush/commands

    # Specify the folders to search for Drush alias files (*.site.yml). These
    # locations are always merged with alias paths defined on the command line
    # or in other configuration files.  On the command line, paths may be
    # separated by a colon (:) on Unix-based systems or a semi-colon (;) on
    # Windows, or multiple --alias-path options may be provided. Note that
    # Drush 8 and earlier did a deep search in ~/.drush and /etc/drush when
    # loading alias files.
    alias-path:
      - '${env.HOME}/.drush/sites'

    # Specify a folder where Drush should store its file based caches. If unspecified, defaults to $HOME/.drush.
    #cache-directory: /tmp/.drush

    # temporary sql dump files created during sql:sync. If unspecified,
    # defaults to $HOME/drush-backups
    # backup-dir: /tmp/drush-backups

  # Not recommended if you have more than one Drupal root on your system.

# The sections below are configuration thats consulted by various commands, outside
# of the option system.
#

sql:
  # An explicit list of tables which should be included in sql-dump and sql-sync.
  tables:
    common:
      - user
      - permissions
      - role_permissions
      - role
  # List of tables whose *data* is skipped by the 'sql-dump' and 'sql-sync'
  # commands when the "--structure-tables-key=common" option is provided.
  # You may add specific tables to the existing array or add a new element.
  structure-tables:
    common:
      - cache
      - 'cache_*'
      - history
      - 'search_*'
      - 'sessions'
      - 'watchdog'
  # List of tables to be omitted entirely from SQL dumps made by the 'sql-dump'
  # and 'sql-sync' commands when the "--skip-tables-key=common" option is
  # provided on the command line.  This is useful if your database contains
  # non-Drupal tables used by some other application or during a migration for
  # example.  You may add new tables to the existing array or add a new element.
  skip-tables:
    common:
      - 'migration_*'

ssh:
  # Specify options to pass to ssh in backend invoke.  The default is to prohibit
  # password authentication, and is included here, so you may add additional
  # parameters without losing the default configuration.
  options: '-o PasswordAuthentication=no'
  # This string is valid for Bash shell. Override in case you need something different. See https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/issues/3816.
  pipefail: 'set -o pipefail; '

notify:
  # Notify when command takes more than 30 seconds.
# duration: 30
  # Specify a command to run. Defaults to Notification Center (OSX) or libnotify (Linux)
# cmd: /path/to/program
  # See src/Commands/core/NotifyCommands.php for more configuration settings.

xh:
  # Start profiling via xhprof/tideways and show a link to the run report.
# link: http://xhprof.local
  # See src/Commands/core/XhprofCommands.php for more configuration settings.
