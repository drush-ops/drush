#
# Examples of valid statements for a Drush runtime config (drush.yml) file.
#
# Use this file to cut down on typing out lengthy and repetitive command line
# options in the Drush commands you use and to avoid mistakes.
#
# Rename this file to drush.yml and optionally copy it to one of the places
# listed below in order of precedence:
#
# 1.  Drupal site folder (e.g. sites/{default|example.com}/drush.yml).
# 2.  Drupal /drush and sites/all/drush folders, or the /drush folder
#       in the directory above the Drupal root.
# 3.  In any location, as specified by the --config (-c) option.
# 4.  User's .drush folder (i.e. ~/.drush/drush.yml).
# 5.  System wide configuration folder (e.g. /etc/drush/drush.yml).
#
# If a configuration file is found in any of the above locations, it will be
# loaded and merged with other configuration files in the search list.
#
# See `drush topic docs:bootstrap` for more information on how bootstrapping
# affects the loading of Drush configuration files.
#
# The Drush configuration system has been factored out Drush and shared with
# the world at https://github.com/consolidation/config. Feel free to use it
# for your projects. Lots more usage information is there.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE regarding configuration file on Windows:
#
# For Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 and later versions is the
# system window configuration folder C:\ProgramData\Drush.  For previous
# versions of Windows is the folder C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Drush.
#
# NOT SUPPORTED YET:
#
# The Drush commands 'rsync' and 'sql-sync' are special cases.  These commands
# will load the configuration file for the site specified by the source
# parameter; however, they do not load the configuration file for the site
# specified by the destination parameter, nor do they load configuration files
# for remote sites.
