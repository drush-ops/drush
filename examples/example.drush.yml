#
# Examples of valid statements for a Drush runtime config (drush.yml) file.
#
# Use this file to cut down on typing out lengthy and repetitive command line
# options in the Drush commands you use and to avoid mistakes.
#
# Rename this file to drush.yml and optionally copy it to one of the places
# listed below in order of precedence:
#
# 1.  Drupal site folder (e.g. sites/{default|example.com}/drush.yml).
# 2.  Drupal /drush and sites/all/drush folders, or the /drush folder
#       in the directory above the Drupal root.
# 3.  In any location, as specified by the --config (-c) option.
# 4.  User's .drush folder (i.e. ~/.drush/drush.yml).
# 5.  System wide configuration folder (e.g. /etc/drush/drush.yml).
#
# If a configuration file is found in any of the above locations, it will be
# loaded and merged with other configuration files in the search list.
#
# NOT SUPPORTED YET:
#
# A future feature will allow configuration files to be restricted to a
# certain version of Drush. e.g. if you create a file called drush10.yml,
# then the configuration options in that file will only be loaded by
# Drush 10. At the moment, though, only Drush 9 loads drush.yml files,
# so this feature is not needed yet.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE regarding configuration file on Windows:
#
# For Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 and later versions is the
# system window configuration folder C:\ProgramData\Drush.  For previous
# versions of Windows is the folder C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Drush.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE on configuration file loading:
#
# At its core, Drush works by "bootstrapping" the Drupal environment in very
# much the same way that is done during a normal page request from the web
# server, so most Drush commands run in the context of a fully-initialized
# website.
#
# Configuration files are loaded in the reverse order they are shown above. All
# configuration files are loaded in the first bootstrapping phase, but
# a configuration file in a specific Drupal site folder other than the default
# (eg, sites/example.com/drush.yml) will not be loaded unless a specific
# Drupal site is selected.  However, it _will_ be loaded if a site is selected
# (either via the current working directory or by use of the --uri option),
# even if the Drush command being run does not bootstrap to the Drupal Site
# phase.
#
# NOT SUPPORTED YET:
#
# The Drush commands 'rsync' and 'sql-sync' are special cases.  These commands
# will load the configuration file for the site specified by the source
# parameter; however, they do not load the configuration file for the site
# specified by the destination parameter, nor do they load configuration files
# for remote sites.
#
# See `drush topic docs:bootstrap` for more information on how bootstrapping
# affects the loading of Drush configuration files.
