# Example bash aliases to improve your drush experience with bash.
# Copy this file to your home directory, rename and customize it to
# suit, and source it from your ~/.bash_profile file.
#
# Example - rename this to .drush_bashrc, and in your
# ~/.bash_profile add:
#
#
#    if [ -f ~/.drush_bashrc ] ; then
#        . ~/.drush_bashrc
#    fi
#
# Features:
#
# Finds and sources drush.complete.sh from your drush directory,
# enabling autocompletion for drush commands.
#
# Creates aliases to common drush commands that work in a global context:
#
#       dr               - drush
#       ddd              - drush drupal-directory
#       dl               - drush pm-download
#       ev               - drush php-eval
#       sa               - drush site-alias
#       sa               - drush site-alias --local (show local site aliases)
#       st               - drush core-status
#       use              - drush site-set
#
# Aliases for drush commands that work on the current drupal site:
#
#       cc               - drush cache-clear
#       cca              - drush cache-clear all
#       dis              - drush pm-disable
#       en               - drush pm-enable
#       i                - drush pm-info
#       pml              - drush pm-list
#       rf               - drush pm-refresh
#       unin             - drush pm-uninstall
#       up               - drush pm-update
#       upc              - drush pm-updatecode
#       updb             - drush updatedb
#       q                - drush sql-query
#
# Provides several common shell commands to work better with drush:
#
#       ddd @dev         - print the path to the root directory of @dev
#       cdd @dev         - change the current working directory to @dev
#       lsd @dev         - ls root folder of @dev
#       lsd %files       - ls "files" directory of current site
#       lsd @dev:%devel  - ls devel module directory in @dev
#       @dev st          - drush @dev core-status
#       dssh @live       - ssh to the remote server @live points at
#       gitd @live pull  - run `git pull` on the drupal root of @live
#
# Drush site alias expansion is also done for the cpd command:
#
#       cpd -R @site1:%files @site2:%files
#
# Note that the 'cpd' alias only works for local sites.  Use
# `drush rsync` or gitd` to move files between remote sites.
#
# By default, aliases are also created for the following standard
# commands:
#
#       cd                - cddl [*]
#       ls                - lsd
#       cp                - cpd
#       ssh               - dssh
#       git               - gitd
#
# These standard commands behave exactly the same as they always
# do, unless a drush site specification such as @dev or @live:%files
# is used in one of the arguments.  If you do not want to override
# these standard commands, they may be easily removed or commented out
# in your copy of this file.
