# Example bash aliases to improve your Drush experience with bash.
# Use `drush init` to copy this file to your home directory, rename and
# customize it to suit, and source it from your ~/.bashrc file.
#
# Creates aliases to common Drush commands that work in a global context:
#
#       dr               - drush
#       ddd              - drush drupal-directory
#       ev               - drush php-eval
#       sa               - drush site-alias
#       sa               - drush site-alias --local-only (show local site aliases)
#       st               - drush core-status
#       use              - drush site-set
#
# Aliases for Drush commands that work on the current drupal site:
#
#       cr               - drush cache-rebuild
#       en               - drush pm-enable
#       pml              - drush pm-list
#       unin             - drush pm-uninstall
#       updb             - drush updatedb
#       q                - drush sql-query
#
# Provides several common shell commands to work better with Drush:
#
#       ddd @dev         - print the path to the root directory of @dev
#       cdd @dev         - change the current working directory to @dev
#       lsd @dev         - ls root folder of @dev
#       lsd %files       - ls "files" directory of current site
#       lsd @dev:%devel  - ls devel module directory in @dev
#       @dev st          - drush @dev core-status
#       dssh @live       - ssh to the remote server @live points at
#       gitd @live pull  - run `git pull` on the drupal root of @live
#
# Drush site alias expansion is also done for the cpd command:
#
#       cpd -R @site1:%files @site2:%files
#
# Note that the 'cpd' alias only works for local sites.  Use
# `drush rsync` or gitd` to move files between remote sites.
#
# Aliases are also possible for the following standard
# commands. Uncomment their definitions below as desired.
#
#       cd                - cddl [*]
#       ls                - lsd
#       cp                - cpd
#       ssh               - dssh
#       git               - gitd
#
# These standard commands behave exactly the same as they always
# do, unless a Drush site specification such as @dev or @live:%files
# is used in one of the arguments.
