drush_make depends on drush (the DRUpal SHell).
To use drush_make, you must first download and install drush from
http://drupal.org/project/drush. Installation instructions can be found at
http://tinyurl.com/drush-installation, which also contains a section about
installing other commands (such as drush_make).

Here's the relevant section.

You can put this folder in a number of places:
- In a .drush folder in your HOME folder. Note, that you have to make the
  .drush folder yourself (so you end up with ~/.drush/drush_make/INSTALL.txt).
- In a folder specified with the include option (see above).
- In /path/to/drush/commands (not a Smart Thing, but it would work).
