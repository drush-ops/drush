# Drush services
#
# This file defines the core Drush service classes.
#
services:
  #
  # logger:
  #   Write messages to the error log.  Note that the Drush logger conforms
  #   to the Psr/Log standard, but has been enhanced to support backend
  #   invoke (the remote end can write logs to the initiating end in real
  #   time, and still return structured results at the end.)
  #
  logger:
    class: Drush\Log\Logger
  #
  # bootstrap.manager:
  #   The bootstrap manager is responsible for keeping track of the bootstrap
  #   objects that know how to bootstrap different frameworks.  Drush will have
  #   a mechanism for this to be extended, e.g. by Backdrop.
