Install/Upgrade a global Drush
---------------
```bash    
# Download latest stable release using the code below or browse to github.com/drush-ops/drush/releases.
wget http://files.drush.org/drush.phar
# Or use our upcoming release: wget http://files.drush.org/drush-unstable.phar  

# Test your install.
php drush.phar core-status

# Rename to `drush` instead of `php drush.phar`. Destination can be anywhere on $PATH. 
chmod +x drush.phar
sudo mv drush.phar /usr/local/bin/drush

# Optional. Enrich the bash startup file with completion and aliases.
drush init
```
    
* MAMP users, and anyone wishing to launch a non-default PHP, needs to [edit ~/.bashrc so that the right PHP is in your $PATH](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4145667/how-to-override-the-path-of-php-to-use-the-mamp-path/10653443#10653443).
* We have documented [alternative ways to install](http://docs.drush.org/en/master/install-alternative/), including [Windows](http://docs.drush.org/en/master/install-alternative/#windows).
* If you need to pass custom php.ini values, run `php -d foo=bar drush.phar --php-options=foo=bar`
* Your shell now has [useful bash aliases and tab completion for command names, site aliases, options, and arguments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drush-ops/drush/master/examples/example.bashrc).
* A [drushrc.php](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drush-ops/drush/master/examples/example.drushrc.php) has been copied to ~/.drush above. Customize it to save typing and standardize options for commands.
* Upgrade using this same procedure.

Install a site-local Drush
-----------------
In addition to the global Drush, it is recommended that Drupal 8 sites be [built using Composer, with Drush listed as a dependency](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project).

1. When you run `drush`, the global Drush is called first and then hands execution to the site-local Drush. This gives you the convenience of running `drush` without specifying the full path to the executable, without sacrificing the safety provided by a site-local Drush.
2. Optional: Copy the [examples/drush.wrapper](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/blob/master/examples/drush.wrapper) file to your project root and modify to taste. This is a handy launcher script; add --local here to turn off all global configuration locations, and maintain consistency over configuration/aliases/commandfiles for your team.
3. Note that if you have multiple Drupal sites on your system, it is possible to use a different version of Drush with each one.
