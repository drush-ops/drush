Drush Configuration
===================

Drush users provide may provide configuration via yml files that are placed in specific directories. [See our example file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drush-ops/drush/master/examples/example.drush.yml) for more information. You may also add configuration to a site alias - [see example site alias](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drush-ops/drush/master/examples/example.site.yml).

If you are authoring a commandfile and wish to access the user's configuration, see [Command Authoring](commands.md).

The Drush configuration system has been factored out of Drush and shared with the world at https://github.com/consolidation/config. Feel free to use it for your projects. Lots more usage information is there.
