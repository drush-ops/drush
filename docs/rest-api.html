<h1>Drush REST API Server</h1>

<p>Drush provides support for exposing its functionality over the web via HTTP or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket</a>.</p>

<p>N.B.: if misused, this feature can open up a rather large security hole in the system that Drush is running on (as well as any other system that Drush may have access to via Drush aliases). That said, this feature <strong>can</strong> be used safely and securely, and we will describe how in this document.</p>

<h2>Use cases</h2>

<p>Probably the most useful scenario for utilizing the Drush REST API server is as part of a continuous integration framework.</p>

<p>Suppose you are writing tests for your site using a Javascript testing framework (for example, CasperJS). Let's say you wanted to test logging in to the Drupal site, filling out a form, and checking to see if an email was sent. By using a Drush REST API server, you could automate the creation and deletion of the test user account as well as checking the watchdog table to see if the email notification was logged, all from within a browser-based JS testing framework.</p>

<p>The Drush REST API server command is also useful for developers building web applications that interact with a user's Drush installation.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that in most cases, using the REST API server's WebSocket implementation will be preferable to the HTTP server. This is because the HTTP server relies on PHP's built-in server, which the PHP team advises against using in a production environment. The WebSocket implementation is built on <a href="http://socketo.me/">Rachet</a>, an open-source PHP library built for real time communication and is usable in production environments. The WebSocket implementation is also deployable over SSL for additional security.<p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To run a Drush REST API server, type <pre>drush rest-api-server start</pre>. By default, Drush will listen at <code>localhost:8080</code> using the WebSocket protocol.</p>

<p>Now open up a browser and enter the following in the browser's console:</p>
<pre>
var conn = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');
conn.onopen = function(e) {
    console.log("Connection established!");
};
conn.onmessage = function(e) {
    console.log(e.data);
};
conn.send('@none/core-status');
</pre>

<p>You should get the output of <pre>drush @none core-status</pre></p>.

<p>Back in your terminal, type <pre>drush rest-api-server stop</pre> to switch off the REST API server.</p>

<h3>Restricting access</h3>

<p>Both the WebSocket and HTTP implementations of the REST API server command allow for restricting client access based on IP address and hostname; so for example you could restrict access to Drush to requests coming from the local machine (127.0.0.1) or from IP address <code>67.207.143.23</code> identified by hostname <code>drush.ws</code>. Note that savvy users and non-browser clients can spoof IP addresses and hostnames.</p>

<p>To increase security, you can also whitelist which commands will be allowed by a requester. By running <code>drush rest-api-server --whitelist=core-status</code>, client requests for any other commands (say, for example, <code>php-eval</code>) will be rejected, and only <code>core-status</code> will be allowed.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best way to boost security is by writing your own Drush command that implements <code>hook_drush_rest_api_process_request_alter</code>. Drush commands that implement this hook have control over processing the incoming API request. This means that you could implement, for example, an encryption scheme to encrypt data sent back to the client from the REST API server.</p>

<h3>Deployment</h3>

<h4>HTTP</h4>
<p>It is not advisable to deploy a Drush REST API server over HTTP in a production environment. That's because PHP's built-in server is used for handling HTTP requests. Here is what PHP's team <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php">has to say about their built-in server functionality</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
This web server was designed to aid application development. It may also be useful for testing purposes or for application demonstrations that are run in controlled environments. It is not intended to be a full-featured web server. It should not be used on a public network.

<h4>WebSocket</h4>

If you use WebSockets, you should read <a href="http://socketo.me/docs/deploy">the Rachet deployment docs</a> thoroughly for tips on secure deployment.</p>
