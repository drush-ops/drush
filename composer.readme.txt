What old style classes do we have?

$ grep -r "^class" . | grep -v vendor/ | grep -v tests/

Next we ignore the Symfony tree which has the old class loader

$ grep -r "^class" . | grep -v vendor | grep -v tests/ | cut -c 1-14 | sort -u
./classes/Drus
./commands/cor
./commands/mak
./commands/pm/
./commands/run
./includes/bat
./includes/cac
./lib/Console_
./lib/Yaml-2.2

We need to add all directories containing classes except ./lib/
