/**
 * Interface for cache implementations.
 *
 * All cache implementations have to implement this interface.
 * JSONCache provides the default implementation, which can be
 * consulted as an example.
 *
 * To make Drush use your implementation for a certain cache bin, you have to
 * set a variable with the name of the cache bin as its key and the name of
 * your class as its value. For example, if your implementation of
 * CacheInterface was called MyCustomCache, the following line in
 * drushrc.php would make Drush use it for the 'example' bin:
 * @code
 *  $options['cache-class-example'] = 'MyCustomCache;
 * @endcode
 *
 * Additionally, you can register your cache implementation to be used by
 * default for all cache bins by setting the option 'cache-default-class' to
 * the name of your implementation of the CacheInterface, e.g.
 * @code
 *  $options['cache-default-class'] = 'MyCustomCache;
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see _drush_cache_get_object()
 * @see \Drupal\Core\Cache\CacheBackendInterface
 *
 * @deprecated
