# Although most aliases will contain only a few options, a number
# of settings that are commonly used appear below:
#
# - 'uri': The value of --uri should always be the same as
#   when the site is being accessed from a web browser (e.g. http://example.com)
# - 'root': The Drupal root; must not be specified as a relative path.
# - 'host': The fully-qualified domain name of the remote system
#   hosting the Drupal instance. **Important Note: The remote-host option
#   must be omitted for local sites, as this option controls various
#   operations, such as whether or not rsync parameters are for local or
#   remote machines, and so on. @see hook_drush_sitealias_alter() in drush.api.php
# - 'user': The username to log in as when using ssh or rsync.
# - 'os': The operating system of the remote server.  Valid values
#   are 'Windows' and 'Linux'. Be sure to set this value for all remote
#   aliases because the default value is PHP_OS if 'remote-host'
#   is not set, and 'Linux' (or $options['remote-os']) if it is. Therefore,
#   if you set a 'remote-host' value, and your remote OS is Windows, if you
#   do not set the 'OS' value, it will default to 'Linux' and could cause
#   unintended consequences, particularly when running 'drush sql-sync'.
# - 'ssh': If the target requires special options, such as a non-
#   standard port, alternative identity file, or alternative
#   authentication method, the `option` entry under the `ssh` item may
#   contain a string of extra options that are used with the ssh command,
#   e.g. "-p 100"
# - 'paths': An array of aliases for common rsync targets.
#   Relative aliases are always taken from the Drupal root.
#   - 'files': Path to 'files' directory.  This will be looked up if not
#     specified.
#   - 'drush-script': Path to the remot Drush command.
# - 'command': These options will only be set if the alias
#   is used with the specified command.  In the example below, the option
#   `--no-dump` will be selected whenever the @stage alias
#   is used in any of the following ways:
#     - `drush @stage sql-sync @self @live`
#     - `drush sql-sync @stage @live`
#     - `drush sql-sync @live @stage`
#   NOTE: Setting boolean options broke with Symfony 3. This will be fixed
#     in a future release. See: https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/issues/2956
#
# Complex example:
#
# @code
# # File: remote.alias.yml
# live:
#   host: server.domain.com
#   user: www-admin
#   root: /other/path/to/drupal
#   uri: http://example.com
#   ssh:
#     options: '-p 100'
#   paths:
#     drush-script: '/path/to/drush'
#   command:
#     site:
#       install:
#         options:
#           admin-password: 'secret-secret'
# @endcode
