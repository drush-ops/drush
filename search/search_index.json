For efficiency and convenience, some Drush commands can work without first bootstrapping a Drupal site, or by only partially bootstrapping a site. This is faster than a full bootstrap. It is also a matter of convenience, because some commands are useful even when you don't have a working Drupal site. Commands may specify their bootstrap level with a @bootstrap annotation. Commands supplied by Drupal modules are always @bootstrap full . Prior to bootstrapping, Drush goes through the preflight process, where the following things occur: Preflight Commandline arguments are parsed. Configuration files are read. The site-alias included on the commandline is loaded if present. The local selected site is determined, if any. Dependency injection is done. Global commandfiles are loaded. Commandfiles with a drush.services.yml are loaded later, during bootstrap @full . The command is dispatched via the Symfony Console component. Bootstrapping is done from a Symfony Console command hook. The different bootstrap levels are discribed below. @bootstrap none \u00b6 Only run Drush preflight , without considering Drupal at all. Any code that operates on the Drush installation, and not specifically any Drupal directory, should bootstrap to this phase. @bootstrap root \u00b6 Set up and test for a valid Drupal root, either through the --root options, or evaluated based on the current working directory. Any code that interacts with an entire Drupal installation, and not a specific site on the Drupal installation should use this bootstrap phase. @bootstrap site \u00b6 Set up a Drupal site directory and the correct environment variables to allow Drupal to find the configuration file. If no site is specified with the --uri options, Drush will assume the site is 'default', which mimics Drupal's behaviour. Note that it is necessary to specify a full URI, e.g. --uri= http://example.com , in order for certain Drush commands and Drupal modules to behave correctly. See the example Config file for more information. Any code that needs to modify or interact with a specific Drupal site's settings.php file should bootstrap to this phase. @bootstrap configuration \u00b6 Load the settings from the Drupal sites directory. This phase is analogous to the DRUPAL_BOOTSTRAP_CONFIGURATION bootstrap phase in Drupal itself, and this is also the first step where Drupal specific code is included. This phase is commonly used for code that interacts with the Drupal install API, as both install.php and update.php start at this phase. @bootstrap database \u00b6 Connect to the Drupal database using the database credentials loaded during the previous bootstrap phase. This phase is analogous to the DRUPAL_BOOTSTRAP_DATABASE bootstrap phase in Drupal. Any code that needs to interact with the Drupal database API needs to be bootstrapped to at least this phase. @bootstrap full \u00b6 Fully initialize Drupal. This is analogous to the DRUPAL_BOOTSTRAP_FULL bootstrap phase in Drupal. Any code that interacts with the general Drupal API should be bootstrapped to this phase. @bootstrap max \u00b6 This is not an actual bootstrap phase. Commands that use the \"max\" bootstrap level will cause Drush to bootstrap as far as possible, and then run the command regardless of the bootstrap phase that was reached. This is useful for Drush commands that work without a bootstrapped site, but that provide additional information or capabilities in the presence of a bootstrapped site. For example, drush status will show progressively more information the farther the site bootstraps.","title":"Bootstrap"},{"location":"bootstrap/#the-drush-bootstrap-process","text":"When preparing to run a command, Drush works by bootstrapping the Drupal environment in very much the same way that is done during a normal page request from the web server, so most Drush commands run in the context of a fully-initialized website.

Follow the steps below. Run drush generate drush-command-file . Drush will prompt for the machine name of the module that should \"own\" the file. (optional) Drush will also prompt for the path to a legacy command file to port. See tips on porting command to Drush 9 The module selected must already exist and be enabled. Use drush generate module-standard to create a new module. Drush will then report that it created a commandfile, a drush.services.yml file and a composer.json file. Edit those files as needed. Use the classes for the core Drush commands at /src/Drupal/Commands as inspiration and documentation. See the dependency injection docs for interfaces you can implement to gain access to Drush config, Drupal site aliases, etc. Write PHPUnit tests based on Drush Test Traits . Once your two files are ready, run drush cr to get your command recognized by the Drupal container. Specifying the Services File \u00b6 A module's composer.json file stipulates the filename where the Drush services (e.g. the Drush command files) are defined. The default services file is drush.services.yml , which is defined in the extra section of the composer.json file as follows: \"extra\" : { \"drush\" : { \"services\" : { \"drush.services.yml\" : \"^9\" } } } If for some reason you need to load different services for different versions of Drush, simply define multiple services files in the services section. The first one found will be used. For example: \"extra\" : { \"drush\" : { \"services\" : { \"drush-9-99.services.yml\" : \"^9.99\" , \"drush.services.yml\" : \"^9\" } } } In this example, the file drush-9-99.services.yml loads commandfile classes that require features only available in Drush 9.99 and later, and drush.services.yml loads an older commandfile implementation for earlier versions of Drush. It is also possible to use version ranges to exactly specify which version of Drush the services file should be used with (e.g. \"drush.services.yml\": \">=9 <9.99\" ). In Drush 9, the default services file, drush.services.yml , will be used in instances where there is no services section in the Drush extras of the project's composer.json file. In Drush 10, however, the services section must exist, and must name the services file to be used. If a future Drush extension is written such that it only works with Drush 10 and later, then its entry would read \"drush.services.yml\": \"^10\" , and Drush 9 would not load the extension's commands. It is all the same recommended that Drush 9 extensions explicitly declare their services file with an appropriate version constraint. Altering Drush Command Info \u00b6 Drush command info (annotations) can be altered from other modules. This is done by creating and registering 'command info alterers'. Alterers are class services that are able to intercept and manipulate an existing command annotation. In order to alter an existing command info, follow the steps below: In the module that wants to alter a command info, add a service class that implements the \\Consolidation\\AnnotatedCommand\\CommandInfoAltererInterface . In the module drush.services.yml declare a service pointing to this class and tag the service with the drush.command_info_alterer tag. In that class, implement the alteration logic in the alterCommandInfo() method. Along with the alter code, it's strongly recommended to log a debug message explaining what exactly was altered. This makes things easier on others who may need to debug the interaction of the alter code with other modules. Also it's a good practice to inject the the logger in the class constructor. For an example, see the alterer class provided by the testing 'woot' module: tests/functional/resources/modules/d8/woot/src/WootCommandInfoAlterer.php . Site-Wide Drush Commands \u00b6 Commandfiles that are installed in a Drupal site and are not bundled inside a Drupal module are called 'site-wide' commandfiles. Site-wide commands may either be added directly to the Drupal site's repository (e.g. for site-specific policy files), or via composer require . See the examples/Commands folder for examples. In general, it's better to use modules to carry your Drush commands, as module-based commands may participate in Drupal's dependency injection via the drush.services.yml . If you still prefer using site-wide commandfiles, here are some examples of valid commandfile names and namespaces: Simple Filename: $PROJECT_ROOT/drush/Commands/ExampleCommands.php Namespace: Drush\\Commands Nested in a subdirectory committed to the site's repository Filename: $PROJECT_ROOT/drush/Commands/example/ExampleCommands.php Namespace: Drush\\Commands\\example Nested in a subdirectory installed via a Composer package Filename: $PROJECT_ROOT/drush/Commands/contrib/dev_modules/ExampleCommands.php Namespace: Drush\\Commands\\dev_modules Note: Make sure you do not include src in the path to your command. Your command may not be discovered and have additional problems. Installing commands as part of a Composer project requires that the project's type be drupal-drush , and that the installer-paths in the Drupal site's composer.json file contains \"drush/Commands/contrib/{$name}\": [\"type:drupal-drush\"] . It is also possible to commit projects with a similar layout using a directory named custom in place of contrib ; if this is done, then the directory custom will not be considered to be part of the commandfile's namespace. If a site-wide commandfile is added via a Composer package, then it may declare any dependencies that it may need in its composer.json file. Site-wide commandfiles that are committed directly to a site's repository only have access to the dependencies already available in the site. Site-wide commandfiles should declare their Drush version compatibility via a conflict directive. For example, a Composer-managed site-wide command that works with both Drush 8 and Drush 9 might contain something similar to the following in its composer.json file: \"conflict\" : { \"drush/drush\" : \"<8.2 || >=9.0 <9.6 || >=10.0\" , } Using require in place of conflict is not recommended. A site-wide commandfile should have tests that run with each (major) version of Drush that is supported. You may model your test suite after the example drush extension project, which works on Drush ^8.2 and ^9.6. Global Drush Commands \u00b6 Commandfiles that are not part of any Drupal site are called 'global' commandfiles. Global commandfiles are not supported by default; in order to enable them, you must configure your drush.yml configuration file to add an include search location. For example: drush : paths : include : - '${env.home}/.drush/commands' With this configuration in place, global commands may be placed as described in the Site-Wide Drush Commands section above. Global commandfiles may not declare any dependencies of their own; they may only use those dependencies already available via the autoloader. Tip The filename must be have a name like Commands/ExampleCommands.php The prefix Example can be whatever string you want. The file must end in Commands.php The directory above Commands must be one of: A Folder listed in the 'include' option. Include may be provided via config or via CLI. ../drush, /drush or /sites/all/drush. These paths are relative to Drupal root. It is recommended that you avoid global Drush commands, and favor site-wide commandfiles instead. If you really need a command or commands that are not part of any Drupal site, consider making a stand-alone script or custom .phar instead. See ahoy , Robo and g1a/starter as potential starting points. Symlinked packages While it is good practice to make your custom commands into a Composer package, please beware that symlinked packages (by using the composer repository type Path ) will not be discovered by Drush.

Quick start \u00b6 If you just want to get started quickly, here is a crontab entry that will run cron once every hour at ten minutes after the hour: 10 * * * * cd [DOCROOT] && /usr/bin/env PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin COLUMNS=72 ../vendor/bin/drush --uri=your.drupalsite.org --quiet cron You should set up crontab to run your cron tasks as the same user that runs the web server; for example, if you run your web server as the user www-data: sudo crontab -u www-data -e You might need to edit the crontab entry shown above slightly for your particular setup; for example, if you have installed Drush to some directory other than /usr/local/drush, then you will need to adjust the path to drush appropriately. We'll break down the meaning of each section of the crontab entry in the documentation that continues below. Setting the schedule \u00b6 See man 5 crontab for information on how to format the information in a crontab entry. In the example above, the schedule for the crontab is set by the string 10 * * * * . These fields are the minute, hour, day of month, month and day of week; * means essentially 'all values', so 10 * * * * will run any time the minute == 10 (once every hour). Setting the PATH \u00b6 We use /usr/bin/env to run Drush so that we can set up some necessary environment variables that Drush needs to execute. By default, cron will run each command with an empty PATH, which would not work well with Drush. To find out what your PATH needs to be, just type: echo $PATH Take the value that is output and place it into your crontab entry in the place of the one shown above. You can remove any entry that is known to not be of interest to Drush (e.g. /usr/games), or is only useful in a graphic environment (e.g. /usr/X11/bin). Setting COLUMNS \u00b6 When running Drush in a terminal, the number of columns will be automatically determined by Drush by way of the tput command, which queries the active terminal to determine what the width of the screen is. When running Drush from cron, there will not be any terminal set, and the call to tput will produce an error message. Spurious error messages are undesirable, as cron is often configured to send email whenever any output is produced, so it is important to make an effort to insure that successful runs of cron complete with no output. In some cases, Drush is smart enough to recognize that there is no terminal -- if the terminal value is empty or \"dumb\", for example. However, there are some \"non-terminal\" values that Drush does not recognize, such as \"unknown.\" If you manually set COLUMNS , then Drush will respect your setting and will not attempt to call tput. Using --quiet \u00b6 By default, Drush will print a success message when the run of cron is completed.

When using this programing paradigm, a class by convention will never use the new operator to instantiate dependencies. Instead, it will store the other objects it needs in class variables, and provide a way for other code to assign an object to that variable. Types of Injection \u00b6 There are two ways that a class can receive its dependencies. One is called \u201cconstructor injection\u201d, and the other is called \u201csetter injection\u201d. Example of constructor injection: public function __construct(DependencyType $service) { $this->service = $service; } Example of setter injection: public function setService(DependencyType $service) { $this->service = $service; } A class should use one or the other of these methods. The code that is responsible for providing the dependencies a class need is usually an object called the dependency injection container. Services Files \u00b6 Drush command files can request that Drupal inject services by using a drush.services.yml file. See creating commands for instructions on how to use the Drupal Code Generator to create a simple command file starter with a drush.services.yml file. An initial services file will look something like this: services : my_module.commands : class : \\Drupal\\my_module\\Commands\\MyModuleiCommands tags : - { name : drush.command } See the Drupal Documentation for details on how to inject Drupal services into your command file. The process is exactly the same as using a Drupal services.yml file to inject services into your module classes. Inflection \u00b6 Drush will also inject dependencies that it provides using a technique called inflection. Inflection is a kind of dependency injection that works by way of a set of provided inflection interfaces, one for each available service. Each of these interfaces will define one or more setter methods (usually only one); these will automatically be called by Drush when the commandfile object is instantiated. The command only needs to implement this method and save the provided object in a class field. There is usually a corresponding trait that may be included via a use statement to fulfill this requirement.

Output formats may be used to select the data type used to print the output. For example, many commands allow the user to select between a human-readable table, or various machine-parsable formats such as yaml and json. Output fields may be used to select and order the data columns. Output filters may be used to limit which data rows are printed based on logical expressions. Output Formats \u00b6 The --format option may be used to select the data format used to print the output of a command. Most commands that produce informative output about some object or system can transform their data into different formats. For example, the version command may be printed in a human-readable table (the default), or in a json array: $ drush version Drush version : 10.3.1 $ drush version --format=json { \"drush-version\": \"10.3.1\" } The available output formats are shown in the help for each command: $ drush help version Show drush version. Options: --format=<json> Select output format. Available: json, string, var_export, yaml. Default is key-value. Output Fields \u00b6 If you wish to limit the number of columns produced by a command, use the --fields option. List the field names in the order they should be displayed: $ drush9 views:list --fields=machine-name,status +-------------------+----------+ | Machine name | Status | +-------------------+----------+ | block_content | Enabled | | comment | Enabled | | comments_recent | Enabled | | content | Enabled | | content_recent | Enabled | | files | Enabled | | frontpage | Enabled | | taxonomy_term | Enabled | | user_admin_people | Enabled | | watchdog | Enabled | | who_s_new | Enabled | | who_s_online | Enabled | | archive | Disabled | | glossary | Disabled | +-------------------+----------+ The available field names are shown in the help text: $ drush9 help views:list Get a list of all views in the system. Options: --fields=FIELDS Available fields: Machine name (machine-name), Name (label), Description (description), Status (status), Tag (tag) [default: \"machine-name,label,description,status\"] Fields may be named either using their human-readable name, or via their machine name. Note also that some commands do not display all of their available data columns by default. To show all available fields, use --fields=* There is also a singluar form --field available. If this form is used, it will also force the output format to string . $ drush views:list --field=machine-name block_content comment comments_recent content content_recent files frontpage taxonomy_term user_admin_people watchdog who_s_new who_s_online archive glossary Output Filters \u00b6 A number of Drush commands that output tabular data support a --filter option that allows rows from the output to be selected with simple logic expressions. In its simplest form, the --filter option takes a string that indicates the value to filter by in the command's default filter field . For example, the role:list command specifies perms as its default filter; the output of the role:list command may be limited to only those roles that have a specified permission: $ drush role:list --filter='post comments' authenticated: label: 'Authenticated user' perms: - 'access comments' - 'access content' - 'access shortcuts' - 'access site-wide contact form' - 'access user contact forms' - 'post comments' - 'search content' - 'skip comment approval' - 'use text format basic_html' Note that not all commands have a default filter field. Other fields in the output may be searched by using a simple expression in the --filter term. For example, to list only the enabled extensions with the pm:list command, you could run: $ drush pm:list --filter='status=enabled' To search for fields that contain a string using the operator *= , or match a regular expression with the ~= operator. For example, to find all views whose machine name contains the word \"content\": drush views:list --filter='machine-name*=content' To use a regular expression to find any core requirement notice whose title contains either \"php\" or \"gd\" drush core:requirements --filter='title~=#(php|gd)#i' Finally, filter expressions may also use logical-and ( && ) or logical-or ( || ) operations to separate multiple terms. Parenthesis are not supported. For example, to search both the title and severity fields in the core:requirements command: drush core:requirements --filter='title~=#(php|gd)#i&&severity=warning' The = and *= operators always use case-insensitive comparisons. The ~= operator is case-sensitive, unless the i PCRE modifier is used, as shown in the previous example. Comparison of Filters with Grep \u00b6 Using the --filter feature is similar to using grep . The main difference is that the filter feature does a semantic search, which is to say that it explicitly compares against the data in specific fields. In comparison, the grep command does a line-based search. Show only results where the severity is \"warning\": drush core:requirements --filter='severity=warning' Show only lines that contain the string \"warning\" (either in the severity field, or somewhere else on the line): drush core:requirements | grep -i warning The table below compares and contrasts the two ways of searching. Feature --filter grep Regular expressions Yes, with ~= Yes Word-wrapped field data Searched correctly Might cause false negative Search just one field Yes Might get false positives Search multiple fields Yes, with || / && Yes (line-based searching) Searching hides header No Yes (unless it matches)","title":"Output Formats, Fields & Filters"},{"location":"output-formats-filters/#output-formats-fields-and-filters","text":"Drush utilizes a powerful formatting and filtering system that provides the user with a lot of control over how output from various commands is rendered.

In its simplest form, the --filter option takes a string that indicates the value to filter by in the command's default filter field . For example, the role:list command specifies perms as its default filter; the output of the role:list command may be limited to only those roles that have a specified permission: $ drush role:list --filter='post comments' authenticated: label: 'Authenticated user' perms: - 'access comments' - 'access content' - 'access shortcuts' - 'access site-wide contact form' - 'access user contact forms' - 'post comments' - 'search content' - 'skip comment approval' - 'use text format basic_html' Note that not all commands have a default filter field. Other fields in the output may be searched by using a simple expression in the --filter term. For example, to list only the enabled extensions with the pm:list command, you could run: $ drush pm:list --filter='status=enabled' To search for fields that contain a string using the operator *= , or match a regular expression with the ~= operator. For example, to find all views whose machine name contains the word \"content\": drush views:list --filter='machine-name*=content' To use a regular expression to find any core requirement notice whose title contains either \"php\" or \"gd\" drush core:requirements --filter='title~=#(php|gd)#i' Finally, filter expressions may also use logical-and ( && ) or logical-or ( || ) operations to separate multiple terms. Parenthesis are not supported. For example, to search both the title and severity fields in the core:requirements command: drush core:requirements --filter='title~=#(php|gd)#i&&severity=warning' The = and *= operators always use case-insensitive comparisons. The ~= operator is case-sensitive, unless the i PCRE modifier is used, as shown in the previous example.","title":"Output Filters"},{"location":"output-formats-filters/#comparison-of-filters-with-grep","text":"Using the --filter feature is similar to using grep . The main difference is that the filter feature does a semantic search, which is to say that it explicitly compares against the data in specific fields. In comparison, the grep command does a line-based search. Show only results where the severity is \"warning\": drush core:requirements --filter='severity=warning' Show only lines that contain the string \"warning\" (either in the severity field, or somewhere else on the line): drush core:requirements | grep -i warning The table below compares and contrasts the two ways of searching. Feature --filter grep Regular expressions Yes, with ~= Yes Word-wrapped field data Searched correctly Might cause false negative Search just one field Yes Might get false positives Search multiple fields Yes, with || / && Yes (line-based searching) Searching hides header No Yes (unless it matches)","title":"Comparison of Filters with Grep"},{"location":"repl/","text":"The php:cli command is interactive PHP REPL with your bootstrapped site (remote or local).

Make a local working clone of your Drupal site and then # `cd` to the project work to select it. # 2. Add an alias file called $PROJECT/drush/sites/self.site.yml, # where $PROJECT is the project root (location of composer.json file). # 3. Run remote commands against the shared live or stage sites # # Following these steps, a cache:rebuild on the live environment would be: # # $ drush @live cache:rebuild # # The site alias file should be named `self.site.yml` because this name is # special, and is used to define the different environments (usually remote) # of the current Drupal site. # # The contents of the alias file should look something like the example below: # # @code # # File: self.site.yml # live: # host: server.domain.com # user: www-admin # root: /other/path/to/live/drupal # uri: http://example.com # stage: # host: server.domain.com # user: www-admin # root: /other/path/to/stage/drupal # uri: http://stage.example.com # @endcode # # The top-level element names (`live` and `stage` in the example above) are # used to identify the different environments available for this site. These # may be used on the command line to select a different target environment # to operate on by prepending an `@` character, e.g. `@live` or `@stage`. # # All of the available aliases for a site's environments may be listed via: # # $ drush site:alias @self # # The elements of a site alias environment are: # # - 'host': The fully-qualified domain name of the remote system # hosting the Drupal instance. **Important Note: The remote-host option # must be omitted for local sites, as this option controls various # operations, such as whether or not rsync parameters are for local or # remote machines, and so on. # - 'user': The username to log in as when using ssh or rsync. If each user # has to use own username, you can create an environment variable which holds # the value, and reference via ${env.PROJECT_SSH_USER} (for example). Or you may # omit the `user:` item and specify a user in the `~/.ssh/config` file. # - 'root': The Drupal root; must not be specified as a relative path. # - 'uri': The value of --uri should always be the same as # when the site is being accessed from a web browser (e.g. http://example.com) # # Drush uses ssh to run commands on remote systems; all team members should # install ssh keys on the target servers (e.g. via ssh-add). # Advanced Site Alias File Usage # # It is also possible to create site alias files that reference other # sites on the same local system. Site alias files for other local sites # are usually stored in the directory `~/.drush/sites`; however, Drush does # not search this location for alias files by default. To use this location, # you must add the path in your Drush configuration file. For example, # to re-add both of the default user alias path from Drush 8, put the following # in your ~/.drush/drush.yml configuration file: # # @code # drush: # paths: # alias-path: # - '${env.HOME}/.drush/sites' # - /etc/drush/sites # @endcode # # The command `drush core:init` will automatically configure your # ~/.drush/drush.yml configuration file to add `~/.drush/sites` and # `/etc/drush/sites` as locations where alias files may be placed. # # A canonical alias named \"example\" that points to a local # Drupal site named \"http://example.com\" looks like this: # # @code # File: example.site.yml # dev: # root: /path/to/drupal # uri: http://example.com # @endcode # # Note that the first part of the filename (in this case \"example\") # defines the name of the site alias, and the top-level key (\"dev\") # defines the name of the environment. # # With these definitions in place, it is possible to run commands targeting # the dev environment of the target site via: # # $ drush @example.dev status # # This command is equivalent to the longer form: # # $ drush --root=/path/to/drupal --uri=http://example.com status # # See \"Additional Site Alias Options\" below for more information. # Converting Legacy Alias Files # # To convert legacy alias (*.aliases.drushrc.php) to yml, run the # site:alias-convert command. # Altering aliases: # # See examples/Commands/SiteAliasAlterCommands.php for an example. # Environment variables: # # Site aliases may reference environment variables, just like any Drush config # file. For example, ${env.PROJECT_SSH_USER} will be replaced by the value # of the PROJECT_SSH_USER environment value. # # SSH site aliases may set environment variables via the 'env-vars' key. # See below. # Additional Site Alias Options # # Aliases are commonly used to define short names for # local or remote Drupal installations; however, an alias # is really nothing more than a collection of options. # # - 'docker': When specified, Drush executes via docker-compose exec rather than ssh # - 'service': the name of the container to run on. # - 'exec': # - 'options': Options for the exec subcommand. # - 'os': The operating system of the remote server. Valid values # are 'Windows' and 'Linux'. Be sure to set this value for all remote # aliases because the default value is PHP_OS if 'remote-host' # is not set, and 'Linux' (or $options['remote-os']) if it is. Therefore, # if you set a 'remote-host' value, and your remote OS is Windows, if you # do not set the 'OS' value, it will default to 'Linux' and could cause # unintended consequences, particularly when running 'drush sql-sync'. # - 'ssh': Contains settings used to control how ssh commands are generated # when running remote commands. # - 'options': Contains additional commandline options for the ssh command # itself, e.g. \"-p 100\" # - 'tty': Usually, Drush will decide whether or not to create a tty (via # the ssh '--t' option) based on whether the local Drush command is running # interactively or not. To force Drush to always or never create a tty, # set the 'ssh.tty' option to 'true' or 'false', respectively. # - 'paths': An array of aliases for common rsync targets. # Relative aliases are always taken from the Drupal root. # - 'files': Path to 'files' directory. This will be looked up if not # specified. # - 'drush-script': Path to the remote Drush command. # - 'command': These options will only be set if the alias # is used with the specified command. In the example below, the option # `--no-dump` will be selected whenever the @stage alias # is used in any of the following ways: # - `drush @stage sql-sync @self @live` # - `drush sql-sync @stage @live` # - `drush sql-sync @live @stage` # NOTE: Setting boolean options broke with Symfony 3. This will be fixed # in a future release. See: https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/issues/2956 # - 'env-vars': An array of key / value pairs that will be set as environment # variables. # # Complex example: # # @code # # File: remote.site.yml # live: # host: server.domain.com # user: www-admin # root: /other/path/to/drupal # uri: http://example.com # ssh: # options: '-p 100' # paths: # drush-script: '/path/to/drush' # env-vars: # PATH: /bin:/usr/bin:/home/www-admin/.composer/vendor/bin # DRUPAL_ENV: live # command: # site: # install: # options: # admin-password: 'secret-secret' # @endcode # Site Alias Files for Service Providers # # There are a number of service providers that manage Drupal sites as a # service. Drush allows service providers to create collections of site alias # files to reference all of the sites available to a single user. In order # to do this, a new location must be defined in your Drush configuration # file: # # @code # drush: # paths: # alias-path: # - '${env.HOME}/.drush/sites/provider-name' # @endcode # # Site aliases stored in this directory may then be referenced by its # full alias name, including its location, e.g.: # # $ drush @provider-name.example.dev # # Such alias files may still be referenced by their shorter name, e.g. # `@example.dev`. Note that it is necessary to individually list every # location where site alias files may be stored; Drush never does recursive # (deep) directory searches for alias files. # # The `site:alias` command may also be used to list all of the sites and # environments in a given location, e.g.: # # $ drush site:alias @provider-name # # Add the option `--format=list` to show only the names of each site and # environment without also showing the values in each alias record. # Wildcard Aliases for Service Providers # # Some service providers that manage Drupal sites allow customers to create # multiple \"environments\" for a site. It is common for these providers to # also have a feature to automatically create Drush aliases for all of a # user's sites. Rather than write one record for every environment in that # site, it is also possible to write a single \"wildcard\" alias that represents # all possible environments. This is possible if the contents of each # environment alias are identical save for the name of the environment in # one or more values. The variable `${env-name}` will be substituted with the # environment name wherever it appears. # # Example wildcard record: # # @code # # File: remote-example.site.yml # '*': # host: ${env-name}.server.domain.com # user: www-admin # root: /path/to/${env-name} # uri: http://${env-name}.remote-example.com # @endcode # # With a wildcard record, any environment name may be used, and will always # match. This is not desirable in instances where the specified environment # does not exist (e.g. if the user made a typo). An alias alter hook in a # policy file may be used to catch these mistakes and report an error. # @see SiteAliasAlterCommands for an example on how to do this. # Developer Information # # See https://github.com/consolidation/site-alias for more developer # information about Site Aliases. # # An example appears below. Edit to suit and remove the @code / @endcode and # leading hashes to enable. # # @code # # File: mysite.site.yml # local: # This environment is an example of the DockerCompose transport. # docker: # service: drupal # exec: # options: --user USER # stage: # uri: http://stage.example.com # root: /path/to/remote/drupal/root # host: mystagingserver.myisp.com # user: publisher # os: Linux # paths: # - files: sites/mydrupalsite.com/files # - custom: /my/custom/path # command: # sql: # sync: # options: # no-dump: true # dev: # root: /path/to/docroot # uri: https://dev.example.com # @endcode # Example of rsync with exclude-paths # # Note that most options typically passed to rsync via `drush rsync` are # \"passthrough options\", which is to say they appear after the `--` separator # on the command line. Passthrough options are actually arguments, and # it is not possible to set default arguments in an alias record. The # `drush rsync` command does support two options, `--mode` and `--exclude-paths`, # which are interpreted directly by Drush. Default values for these options # may be specified in an alias record, as shown below. # # @code # dev: # root: /path/to/docroot # uri: https://dev.example.com # command: # core: # rsync: # options: # mode: rlptz # exclude-paths: 'css:imagecache:ctools:js:tmp:php:styles' # @endcode","title":"site.yml"},{"location":"examples/git-bisect.example.sh/","text":"#!/usr/bin/env sh # # Git bisect is a helpful way to discover which commit an error # occurred in.
