drush (4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #609362)
    This branch (4.x) is likely to live only in sid considering upstream
    is already considering a 5.x release. In general, the release cycle of
    Debian and Drush are incompatible, the latter being roughly every 6
    months. I will try to keep sid (and therefore testing) up to date with
    the upstream stable and people will be free to use 3.3 (in squeeze or
    lenny-backports) or whatever the latest stable upstream is (in sid or
    testing).

  * standards upgrade to 3.9.1 - no change
  * update table.inc to follow upstream

drush (3.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (Closes: #594020)
    This is the last "unclean" version of Drush 3. Further version will
    contain only security upgrades and critical bugfixes that can be
    targeted at Debian stable. As the maintainer of the Drush stable
    branch, I can commit to such a policy.
