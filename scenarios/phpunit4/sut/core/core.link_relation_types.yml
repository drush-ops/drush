payment:

  notes: "This relation type registration did not indicate a reference.  Requested by Joshua Kinberg and Robert Sayre.  It is meant as a general way to facilitate acts of payment, and thus this specification makes no assumptions on the type of payment or transaction protocol.  Examples may include a web page where donations are accepted or where goods and services are available for purchase. rel=\"payment\" is not intended to initiate an automated transaction.  In Atom documents, a link element with a rel=\"payment\" attribute may exist at the feed/channel level and/or the entry/item level.  For example, a rel=\"payment\" link at the feed/channel level may point to a \"tip jar\" URI, whereas an entry/ item containing a book review may include a rel=\"payment\" link that points to the location where the book may be purchased through an online retailer."
