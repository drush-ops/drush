/**
 * Filters a RecursiveDirectoryIterator to discover extensions.
 *
 * To ensure the best possible performance for extension discovery, this
 * filter implementation hard-codes a range of assumptions about directories
 * in which Drupal extensions may appear and in which not. Every unnecessary
 * subdirectory tree recursion is avoided.
 *
 * The list of globally ignored directory names is defined in the
 * RecursiveExtensionFilterIterator::$blacklist property.
 *
 * In addition, all 'config' directories are skipped, unless the directory path
 * ends with 'modules/config', so as to still find the config module provided by
 * Drupal core and still allow that module to be overridden with a custom config
 * module.
 *
 * Lastly, ExtensionDiscovery instructs this filter to additionally skip all
 * 'tests' directories at regular runtime, since just with Drupal core only, the
 * discovery process yields 4x more extensions when tests are not ignored.
 *
 * @see ExtensionDiscovery::scan()
 * @see ExtensionDiscovery::scanDirectory()
 *
 * @todo Use RecursiveCallbackFilterIterator instead of the $acceptTests
 *   parameter forwarding once PHP 5.4 is available.
