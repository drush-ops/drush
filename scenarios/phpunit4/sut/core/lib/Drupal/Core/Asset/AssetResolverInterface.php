   * module styles through CSS selectors.
   *
   * Themes may replace module-defined CSS files by adding a stylesheet with the
   * same filename. For example, themes/bartik/system-menus.css would replace
   * modules/system/system-menus.css. This allows themes to override complete
   * CSS files, rather than specific selectors, when necessary.
   *
   * Also invokes hook_css_alter(), to allow CSS assets to be altered.
