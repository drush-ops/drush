/**
 * A wrapper class for creating and managing database transactions.
 *
 * Not all databases or database configurations support transactions. For
 * example, MySQL MyISAM tables do not. It is also easy to begin a transaction
 * and then forget to commit it, which can lead to connection errors when
 * another transaction is started.
 *
 * This class acts as a wrapper for transactions. To begin a transaction,
 * simply instantiate it. When the object goes out of scope and is destroyed
 * it will automatically commit. It also will check to see if the specified
 * connection supports transactions. If not, it will simply skip any transaction
 * commands, allowing user-space code to proceed normally. The only difference
 * is that rollbacks won't actually do anything.
 *
 * In the vast majority of cases, you should not instantiate this class
 * directly. Instead, call ->startTransaction(), from the appropriate connection
 * object.
