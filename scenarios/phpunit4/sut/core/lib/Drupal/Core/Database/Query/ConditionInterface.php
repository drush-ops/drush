interface ConditionInterface {

  /**
   * Helper function: builds the most common conditional clauses.
   *
   * This method takes 1 to 3 parameters.
   *
   * If called with 1 parameter, it should be a ConditionInterface that in
   * itself forms a valid where clause. Use e.g. to build clauses with nested
   * AND's and OR's.
   *
   * If called with 2 parameters, they are taken as $field and $value with
   * $operator having a value of =.
   *
   * Do not use this method to test for NULL values. Instead, use
   * QueryConditionInterface::isNull() or QueryConditionInterface::isNotNull().
   *
   * To improve readability, the operators EXISTS and NOT EXISTS have their own
   * utility method defined.
   *
   * Drupal considers LIKE case insensitive and the following is often used
   * to tell the database that case insensitive equivalence is desired:
   * @code
   * db_select('users')
   *  ->condition('name', db_like($name), 'LIKE')
   * @endcode
   * Use 'LIKE BINARY' instead of 'LIKE' for case sensitive queries.
   *
   * Note: When using MySQL, the exact behavior also depends on the used
   * collation. if the field is set to binary, then a LIKE condition will also
   * be case sensitive and when a case insensitive collation is used, the =
   * operator will also be case insensitive.
   *
   * @param string|\Drupal\Core\Database\Query\ConditionInterface $field
   *   The name of the field to check. This can also be QueryConditionInterface
   *   in itself. Use where(), if you would like to add a more complex condition
   *   involving operators or functions, or an already compiled condition.
   * @param string|array|\Drupal\Core\Database\Query\SelectInterface|null $value
   *   The value to test the field against. In most cases, and depending on the
   *   operator, this will be a scalar or an array. As SQL accepts select
   *   queries on any place where a scalar value or set is expected, $value may
   *   also be a(n array of) SelectInterface(s). If $operator is a unary
   *   operator, e.g. IS NULL, $value will be ignored and should be null. If
   *   the operator requires a subquery, e.g. EXISTS, the $field will be ignored
   *   and $value should be a SelectInterface object.
   * @param string|null $operator
   *   The operator to use. Supported for all supported databases are at least:
   *   - The comparison operators =, <>, <, <=, >, >=.
   *   - The operators (NOT) BETWEEN, (NOT) IN, (NOT) EXISTS, (NOT) LIKE.
   *   Other operators (e.g. LIKE, BINARY) may or may not work. Defaults to =.
   *
   * @return \Drupal\Core\Database\Query\ConditionInterface
   *   The called object.
