 *   - It can take a given directory, and determine if it can operate on it.
 *   - It can move the contents of that directory into the appropriate place
 *     on the system using FileTransfer classes.
 *   - It can return a list of "next steps" after an update or install.
 *   - In the future, it will most likely perform some of those steps as well.
