/**
 * Defines a Drupal stream wrapper extension.
 *
 * Provides a Drupal interface and classes to implement PHP stream wrappers for
 * public, private, and temporary files. Extends the PhpStreamWrapperInterface
 * with methods expected by Drupal stream wrapper classes.
 *
 * A stream wrapper is an abstraction of a file system that allows Drupal to
 * use the same set of methods to access both local files and remote resources.
 *
 * Note that PHP 5.2 fopen() only supports URIs of the form "scheme://target"
 * despite the fact that according to RFC 3986 a URI's scheme component
 * delimiter is in general just ":", not "://".  Because of this PHP limitation
 * and for consistency Drupal will only accept URIs of form "scheme://target".
 *
 * @see http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3986.html
 * @see http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=47070
