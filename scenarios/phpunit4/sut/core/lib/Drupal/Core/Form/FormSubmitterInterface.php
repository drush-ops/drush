   * destination should be, based on the $form_state and the 'destination'
   * query string in the request URL, and redirects the user there.

   * listed there. If the result is FALSE, then the user will not be redirected.

   * Here is an example of how to set up a form to redirect to the path 'user':
   * @code
   * $form_state->setRedirect('user.page');
   * @endcode
   * And here is an example of how to redirect to 'node/123?foo=bar#baz':
   * @code
   * $form_state->setRedirect('entity.node.canonical',
   *   array('node' => 123),
   *   array(
   *     'query' => array(
   *       'foo' => 'bar',
