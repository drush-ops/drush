   * @param $form
   *   An associative array containing the structure of the form, which is

   *   structure (like #process and #after_build callbacks during form building)
   *   in case of a validation error. If a validation handler alters the form
   *   structure, it is responsible for validating the values of changed form
   *   elements in $form_state->getValues() to prevent form submit handlers from
   *   receiving unvalidated values.
   * @param $form_state
   *   The current state of the form. The current user-submitted data is stored
   *   in $form_state->getValues(), though form validation functions are passed
   *   an explicit copy of the values for the sake of simplicity. Validation
   *   handlers can also use $form_state to pass information on to submit
   *   handlers. For example:
   *     $form_state->set('data_for_submission', $data);
   *   This technique is useful when validation requires file parsing,
   *   web service requests, or other expensive requests that should
   *   not be repeated in the submission step.
