   * value for each context that it adds. For example:
   *
   * @code
   *   // Determine a specific node to pass as context to a block.
   *   $node = ...

   * @endcode
   *
   * On the other hand, there are cases, on which providers no longer are
   * possible to provide context objects, even without the value, so the caller
   * should not expect it.
   *
   * @param string[] $unqualified_context_ids
   *   The requested context IDs. The context provider must only return contexts
   *   for those IDs.
   *
   * @return \Drupal\Core\Plugin\Context\ContextInterface[]
   *   The determined available contexts, keyed by the unqualified context_id.
   *
   * @see \Drupal\Core\Plugin\Context\ContextProviderInterface:getAvailableContexts()

   * about the value, since the value can be different for each request, and
   * might not be available at all during the configuration UI's request.
   *
   * For example:
   * @code
   *   // During configuration, there is no specific node to pass as context.
   *   // However, inform the system that a context named 'node' is
   *   // available, and provide its definition, so that context aware plugins
   *   // can be configured to use it. When the plugin, for example a block,
   *   // needs to evaluate the context, the value of this context will be
   *   // supplied by getRuntimeContexts().
   *   $context = EntityContext::fromEntityTypeId('node');
