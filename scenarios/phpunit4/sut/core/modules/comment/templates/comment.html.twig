 *   @code
 *   {{ content|without('field_example') }}
 *   @endcode

 *   Preprocess functions can reformat it by calling format_date() with the
 *   desired parameters on the 'comment.created' variable.

 *   Preprocess functions can reformat it by calling format_date() with the
 *   desired parameters on the 'comment.changed' variable.

 *   - by-{entity-type}-author: Comment by the author of the parent entity,
 *     eg. by-node-author.
 *   - preview: When previewing a new or edited comment.
 *   The following applies only to viewers who are registered users:
 *   - unpublished: An unpublished comment visible only to administrators.
 * - title_prefix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed in front of the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - title_suffix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed after the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - content_attributes: List of classes for the styling of the comment content.
 * - title_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the main title
 *   tag that appears in the template.
 * - threaded: A flag indicating whether the comments are threaded or not.

 *   visually-hidden.

 * - comment: Full comment object.
