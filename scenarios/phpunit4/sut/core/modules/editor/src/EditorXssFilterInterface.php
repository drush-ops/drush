   * - loading a non-XSS-safe text editor for a $format that contains a filter
   *   preventing XSS attacks (a FilterInterface::TYPE_HTML_RESTRICTOR filter):
   *   if the output is safe, it should also be safe to edit.
   * - loading a non-XSS-safe text editor for a $format that doesn't contain a
   *   filter preventing XSS attacks, but we're switching from a previous text
   *   format ($original_format is not NULL) that did prevent XSS attacks: if
   *   the output was previously safe, it should be safe to switch to another
   *   text format and edit.
   *
   * @param string $html
   *   The HTML to be filtered.
   * @param \Drupal\filter\FilterFormatInterface $format
   *   The text format configuration entity. Provides context based upon which
   *   one may want to adjust the filtering.
   * @param \Drupal\filter\FilterFormatInterface|null $original_format
   *   (optional) The original text format configuration entity (when switching
   *   text formats/editors). Also provides context based upon which one may
   *   want to adjust the filtering.
   *
   * @return string
   *   The filtered HTML that cannot cause any XSSes anymore.
