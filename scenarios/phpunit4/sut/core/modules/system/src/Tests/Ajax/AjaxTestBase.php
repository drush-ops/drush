   * Asserts the array of Ajax commands contains the searched command.
   *
   * An AjaxResponse object stores an array of Ajax commands. This array
   * sometimes includes commands automatically provided by the framework in
   * addition to commands returned by a particular controller. During testing,
   * we're usually interested that a particular command is present, and don't
   * care whether other commands precede or follow the one we're interested in.
   * Additionally, the command we're interested in may include additional data
   * that we're not interested in. Therefore, this function simply asserts that
   * one of the commands in $haystack contains all of the keys and values in
   * $needle. Furthermore, if $needle contains a 'settings' key with an array
   * value, we simply assert that all keys and values within that array are
   * present in the command we're checking, and do not consider it a failure if
   * the actual command contains additional settings that aren't part of
   * $needle.
   *
   * @param $haystack
   *   An array of rendered Ajax commands returned by the server.
   * @param $needle
   *   Array of info we're expecting in one of those commands.
   * @param $message
   *   An assertion message.
