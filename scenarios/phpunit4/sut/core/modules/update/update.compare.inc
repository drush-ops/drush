/**
 * Calculates the current update status of a specific project.
 *
 * This function is the heart of the update status feature. For each project it
 * is invoked with, it first checks if the project has been flagged with a
 * special status like "unsupported" or "insecure", or if the project node
 * itself has been unpublished. In any of those cases, the project is marked
 * with an error and the next project is considered.
 *
 * If the project itself is valid, the function decides what major release
 * series to consider. The project defines what the currently supported major
 * versions are for each version of core, so the first step is to make sure the
 * current version is still supported. If so, that's the target version. If the
 * current version is unsupported, the project maintainer's recommended major
 * version is used. There's also a check to make sure that this function never
 * recommends an earlier release than the currently installed major version.
 *
 * Given a target major version, the available releases are scanned looking for
 * the specific release to recommend (avoiding beta releases and development
 * snapshots if possible). For the target major version, the highest patch level
 * is found. If there is a release at that patch level with no extra ("beta",
 * etc.), then the release at that patch level with the most recent release date
 * is recommended. If every release at that patch level has extra (only betas),
 * then the latest release from the previous patch level is recommended. For
 * example:
 *
 * - 1.6-bugfix <-- recommended version because 1.6 already exists.
 * - 1.6
 *
 * or
 *
 * - 1.6-beta
 * - 1.5 <-- recommended version because no 1.6 exists.
 * - 1.4
 *
 * Also, the latest release from the same major version is looked for, even beta
 * releases, to display to the user as the "Latest version" option.
 * Additionally, the latest official release from any higher major versions that
 * have been released is searched for to provide a set of "Also available"
 * options.
 *
 * Finally, and most importantly, the release history continues to be scanned
 * until the currently installed release is reached, searching for anything
 * marked as a security update. If any security updates have been found between
 * the recommended release and the installed version, all of the releases that
 * included a security fix are recorded so that the site administrator can be
 * warned their site is insecure, and links pointing to the release notes for
 * each security update can be included (which, in turn, will link to the
 * official security announcements for each vulnerability).
 *
 * This function relies on the fact that the .xml release history data comes
 * sorted based on major version and patch level, then finally by release date
 * if there are multiple releases such as betas from the same major.patch
 * version (e.g., 5.x-1.5-beta1, 5.x-1.5-beta2, and 5.x-1.5). Development
 * snapshots for a given major version are always listed last.
 *
 * @param $project_data
 *   An array containing information about a specific project.
 * @param $available
 *   Data about available project releases of a specific project.
