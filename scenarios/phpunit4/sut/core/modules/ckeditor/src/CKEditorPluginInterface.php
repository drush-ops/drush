/**
 * Defines an interface for (loading of) CKEditor plugins.
 *
 * This is the most basic CKEditor plugin interface; it provides the bare
 * minimum information. Solely implementing this interface is not sufficient to
 * be able to enable the plugin though â€” a CKEditor plugin can either be enabled
 * automatically when a button it provides is present in the toolbar, or when
 * some programmatically defined condition is true. In the former case,
 * implement the CKEditorPluginButtonsInterface interface, in the latter case,
 * implement the CKEditorPluginContextualInterface interface. It is also
 * possible to implement both, for advanced use cases.
 *
 * Finally, if your plugin must be configurable, you can also implement the
 * CKEditorPluginConfigurableInterface interface.
