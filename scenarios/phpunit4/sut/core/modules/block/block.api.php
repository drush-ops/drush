/**
 * @defgroup block_api Block API
 * @{
 * Information about the classes and interfaces that make up the Block API.
 *
 * Blocks are a combination of a configuration entity and a plugin. The
 * configuration entity stores placement information (theme, region, weight) and
 * any other configuration that is specific to the block. The block plugin does
 * the work of rendering the block's content for display.
 *
 * To define a block in a module you need to:
 * - Define a Block plugin by creating a new class that implements the
 *   \Drupal\Core\Block\BlockPluginInterface, in namespace Plugin\Block under your
 *   module namespace. For more information about creating plugins, see the
 *   @link plugin_api Plugin API topic. @endlink
 * - Usually you will want to extend the \Drupal\Core\Block\BlockBase class, which
 *   provides a common configuration form and utility methods for getting and
 *   setting configuration in the block configuration entity.
 * - Block plugins use the annotations defined by
 *   \Drupal\Core\Block\Annotation\Block. See the
 *   @link annotation Annotations topic @endlink for more information about
 *   annotations.
 *
 * The Block API also makes use of Condition plugins, for conditional block
 * placement. Condition plugins have interface
 * \Drupal\Core\Condition\ConditionInterface, base class
 * \Drupal\Core\Condition\ConditionPluginBase, and go in plugin namespace
 * Plugin\Condition. Again, see the Plugin API and Annotations topics for
 * details of how to create a plugin class and annotate it.
 *
 * There are also several block-related hooks, which allow you to affect
 * the content and access permissions for blocks:
 * - hook_block_view_alter()
 * - hook_block_view_BASE_BLOCK_ID_alter()
 * - hook_block_access()
 *
 * Further information and examples:
 * - \Drupal\system\Plugin\Block\SystemPoweredByBlock provides a simple example
 *   of defining a block.
 * - \Drupal\user\Plugin\Condition\UserRole is a straightforward example of a
 *   block placement condition plugin.
 * - \Drupal\book\Plugin\Block\BookNavigationBlock is an example of a block with
 *   a custom configuration form.
 * - For a more in-depth discussion of the Block API, see
 *   https://www.drupal.org/developing/api/8/block_api.
 * - The Examples for Developers project also provides a Block example in
 *   https://www.drupal.org/project/examples.

 *
 * This hook is called after the content has been assembled in a structured
 * array and may be used for doing processing which requires that the complete
 * block content structure has been built.
 *
 * If the module wishes to act on the rendered HTML of the block rather than
 * the structured content array, it may use this hook to add a #post_render
 * callback. Alternatively, it could also implement hook_preprocess_HOOK() for
 * block.html.twig. See drupal_render() documentation or the
 * @link themeable Default theme implementations topic @endlink for details.
 *
 * In addition to hook_block_view_alter(), which is called for all blocks, there
 * is hook_block_view_BASE_BLOCK_ID_alter(), which can be used to target a
 * specific block or set of similar blocks.
 *
 * @param array &$build
