/**
 * Trait for ResourceTestBase subclasses testing $auth=NULL, i.e. authless/anon.
 *
 * Characteristics:
 * - When no authentication provider is being used, there also cannot be any
 *   particular error response for missing authentication, since by definition
 *   there is not any authentication.
 * - For the same reason, there are no authentication edge cases to test.
 * - Because no authentication is required, this is vulnerable to CSRF attacks
 *   by design. Hence a REST resource should probably only allow for anonymous
 *   for safe (GET/HEAD) HTTP methods, and only with extreme care should unsafe
 *   (POST/PATCH/DELETE) HTTP methods be allowed for a REST resource that allows
 *   anonymous access.
