# Before Drupal 8.2, EntityResource used permissions as well as the entity
# access system for access checking. This was confusing, and it only did this
# for historical reasons. New Drupal installations opt out from this by default
# (hence this is set to false), existing installations opt in to it.
# @see rest_update_8203()
# @see https://www.drupal.org/node/2664780
