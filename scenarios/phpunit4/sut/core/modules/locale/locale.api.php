 * .info.yml file properties for interface translation settings.
 *
 * For modules hosted on drupal.org, a project definition is automatically added
 * to the .info.yml file. Only modules with this project definition are
 * discovered by the update module and use it to check for new releases. Locale
 * module uses the same data to build a list of modules to check for new
 * translations. Therefore modules not hosted at drupal.org, such as custom
 * modules, custom themes, features and distributions, need a way to identify
 * themselves to the Locale module if they have translations that require to be
 * updated.
 *
 * Custom modules which contain new strings should provide po file(s) containing
 * source strings and string translations in gettext format. The translation
 * file can be located both local and remote. Use the following .info.yml file
 * properties to inform Locale module to load and import the translations.
 *
 * Example .info.yml file properties for a custom module with a po file located
 * in the module's folder.
 * @code
 * 'interface translation project': example_module
 * 'interface translation server pattern': modules/custom/example_module/%project-%version.%language.po
 * @endcode
 *
 * Streamwrappers can be used in the server pattern definition. The interface
 * translations directory (Configuration > Media > File system) can be addressed
 * using the "translations://" streamwrapper. But also other streamwrappers can
 * be used.
 * @code
 * 'interface translation server pattern': translations://%project-%version.%language.po
 * @endcode
 * @code
 * 'interface translation server pattern': public://translations/%project-%version.%language.po
 * @endcode
 *
 * Multiple custom modules or themes sharing the same po file should have
 * matching definitions. Such as modules and sub-modules or multiple modules in
 * the same project/code tree. Both "interface translation project" and
 * "interface translation server pattern" definitions of these modules should
 * match.
 *
 * Example .info.yml file properties for a custom module with a po file located
 * on a remote translation server.
 * @code
 * 'interface translation project': example_module
 * 'interface translation server pattern': http://example.com/files/translations/%core/%project/%project-%version.%language.po
 * @endcode
 *
 * Custom themes, features and distributions can implement these .info.yml file
 * properties in their .info.yml file too.
 *
 * To change the interface translation settings of modules and themes hosted at
 * drupal.org use hook_locale_translation_projects_alter(). Possible changes
 * include changing the po file location (server pattern) or removing the
 * project from the translation update list.
 *
 * Available .info.yml file properties:
 * - "interface translation project": project name. Required.
 *   Name of the project a (sub-)module belongs to. Multiple modules sharing
 *   the same project name will be listed as one the translation status list.
 * - "interface translation server pattern": URL of the .po translation files
 *   used to download the files from. The URL contains tokens which will be
 *   replaced by appropriate values. The file can be locate both at a local
 *   relative path, a local absolute path and a remote server location.
 *
 * The following tokens are available for the server pattern:
 * - "%core": Core version. Value example: "8.x".
 * - "%project": Project name. Value examples: "drupal", "media_gallery".
 * - "%version": Project version release. Value examples: "8.1", "8.x-1.0".
 * - "%language": Language code. Value examples: "fr", "pt-pt".
