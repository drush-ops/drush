/**

 * Theme override for a system settings form.

 * This template will be used when a system config form specifies 'config_form'
 * as its #theme callback.  Otherwise, by default, system config forms will be
 * themed by form.html.twig. This does not alter the appearance of a form at all,
 * but is provided as a convenience for themers.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - form: The confirm form.
